The purpose of this project is to create a visual communication tool in the form of a web-based app intended for use on mobile platforms to assist users with communication disabilities. Instances include users with a communication disability such as Apraxia, a motor disorder in which the patient is unable to perform certain tasks or movements despite full understanding and willingness. In Apraxia of speech, patients have difficulty conveying ideas and thoughts from the brain to the spoken words. Apraxia of speech can manifest itself after incidents such as a stroke or trauma.
